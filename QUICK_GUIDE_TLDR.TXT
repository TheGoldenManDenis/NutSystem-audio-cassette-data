==== QUICK GUIDE FOR ENCODING ====

* Download NutSystem and extract to a folder.
* Open terminal, cd to the folder, then do this:
   chmod +x *.sh
  to make the scripts executable
* Then do this:
  ./EncodingScript.sh /path/to/input/file.ext
* Look inside the _encoder_output_files directory to find the output file
* Import the output file into Audacity (or some other audio editor) as Raw Audio with these settings:
  Unsigned 8bit PCM
  Little Endian (or No Endianness)
  1 Channel (Mono)
  44100 Hz
* Record on cassette tape or whatever

==== QUICK GUIDE FOR DECODING ====

* Record the signal back in from the cassette tape, or whatever
* Make sure there's a period of at least two seconds of tape noise/blank tape recording at the start of the recording, and no loud transients/clicks/pops in that period of noise, otherwise you will probably get 'start signal error'
* Export as raw unsigned 8bit PCM 
* Do this:
  ./DecodingScript.sh [path to input.raw] [path to output file]
  If the specified output file already exists, the script should immediately exit without doing anything, but I can't guarantee this and you should be careful and back up all your data before using NutSystem.
  
==== REQUIREMENTS ====

* Brandy Basic V interpreter (NutSystem is written in BBC Basic)
* X window system (Brandy requires it)
* ALSA ('arecord' command is used by 'startingscript.sh')

==== SIGNED 16 BIT CONVERSION ====

NutSystem prefers unsigned 8 bit raw PCM. But you can also use signed 16 bit raw PCM, but ONLY if you want to. To do this, edit the "signal_filter" program and change the variable converts16% to TRUE. Then if you want to use the StartingScripts to record directly from the tape, you'll need to edit them and change the arecord command.
